                <strong>Patient Data Use Agreement (pDUA)</strong> is a contract

                The pDUA is evidence for patients of how the service provider's
                will use, or not use, their information. More than just terms
                &amp; conditions, the pDUA gives options for the terms of the
                agreement itself. It allows everyone to assess the
                trustworthiness and practices of a third party service. Options
                also include how data is transitioned, if the agreement is
                terminated. Patients need to be on the same legal altitude as
                healthcare services, apps, and hospitals. A binding data
                contract, governed by the patients, is critical to putting
                patients in control and protecting patients from corporate
                overreach.

                <strong>Patient Data Manager (PDM)</strong> is a digital service
                working on behalf of a patient to continually find, retrieve,
                add, edit, correct, and normalize data and construct a person's
                longitudinal health record. Because a patient's data comes from
                many places, the PDM takes it and puts it into the same place
                (one, comprehensive health record).

                <strong>Patient Data Receipt (PDR)</strong> is a digital record,

                visit, every reading from a wearable, and all activity is
                digitally captured. The transaction between the service(s) and
                that patient is recorded in a PDR, and sent to the patient and
                legally required parties.

                <strong>Standard Patient Health Record</strong> is a digital

                consistent definition of health data (structure, terminology,
                content) for the US and planet. It is the gold source data for a
                patient's health. The standard patient health record
                specification contains definitions for all critical patient
                information such as ID, emergency care, primary care, oncology
                care, with future extensions for representing human biology,
                behavior, environment, and social circumstances in code.
