                <strong>Result Summary</strong> is a contract between the
                patient and a service provider that states in clear, simple
                language or graphics, how data will be used and accessed. The
                pDUA is evidence for patients of how the service provider's will
                use, or not use, their information. More than just terms &
                conditions, the pDUA gives options for the terms of the
                agreement itself. It allows everyone to assess the
                trustworthiness and practices of a third party service. Options
                also include how data is transitioned, if the agreement is
                terminated. Patients need to be on the same legal altitude as
                healthcare services, apps, and hospitals. A binding data
                contract, governed by the patients, is critical to putting
                patients in control and protecting patients from corporate
                overreach.
