# Digital Health Service Components

We need to see the major components of a digital health service from data to data use to decision-making.

Much like the OSI model (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model), the open source digital health service components is a stack of common elements and terms.

The current Figma design:

The web viewer and README can be found in:

Current questions/issues:
Does it work for 80% of all healthcare?
How do we incorporate trauma & surgery?
This isnâ€™t linear. How do we show that non-linearity?
Need the builder perspective, the engineering POV.

Note on terminology, since it's evolving:
We're using "Patient Reported Data" (which is a superset of Patient Reported Outcomes).
